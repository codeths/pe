# PE Board

PE Board is a project that helps everyone come to PE classes prepared. Gym teachers have access to a spreadsheet which allows them to control what shows up for their class for each period and for every day. The PE Board, shown on TVs in the gym wing, changes throughout the day to indicate the classes for the current period.
